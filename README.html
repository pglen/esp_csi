<h2>1 Introduction</h2>

<h3>1.1 Introduction to CSI</h3>

<p>Channel state information (CSI) includes specific indicators such as
carrier signal strength, amplitude, phase, and signal delay. These
indicators reveal the signal scattering, reflection, and power attenuation
phenomena that occur with the carrier as the transmission distance changes.
It can be used to measure the channel status of the wireless network in
Wi-Fi communication. By analyzing and studying the changes in CSI, we can
conversely speculate on the changes in the physical environment that cause
the changes in the channel state, that is, to achieve non-contact
intelligent sensing. CSI is extremely sensitive to environmental changes.
In addition to perceiving environmental changes caused by large movements
such as walking and running of people or animals, it can also capture
subtle movements caused by small movements such as breathing and chewing of
people or animals in a static environment.</p>

<h3>1.2 The relationship between CSI and RSSI</h3>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Level of detail:</strong> CSI provides more detailed information about the
wireless channel, including amplitude, phase, and frequency response. RSSI,
on the other hand, only provides a general measurement of signal strength.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Applications:</strong> Wi-Fi CSI is particularly useful for advanced
applications that require fine-grained analysis of the wireless channel,
such as indoor localization, gesture recognition, and activity detection.
RSSI is commonly used for basic tasks like signal strength estimation and
basic proximity-based applications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> CSI can offer higher accuracy in certain applications
compared to RSSI. It allows for more precise localization and tracking, as
well as better differentiation between different actions or gestures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hardware support:</strong> Both CSI and RSSI can be obtained from standard
Wi-Fi receivers, but CSI requires more advanced hardware capabilities to
capture and process the detailed channel information. RSSI, being a simpler
measurement, can be obtained with most Wi-Fi receivers.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In summary, Wi-Fi CSI provides more detailed and fine-grained information
about the wireless channel, while RSSI is a simpler measurement of signal
strength. CSI enables more advanced applications but requires more
sophisticated hardware and analysis techniques.</p>

<h3>1.3 Advantages of CSI</h3>

<p>CSI is a physical layer characteristic.Compared with other indicators, CSI
amplitude shows some advantages:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Anti-interference:</strong> CSI amplitude is essentially the attenuation
coefficient of a set of channels. As long as the channel itself does not
change, it is quite robust to interference from power adaptors and other
jumpers.</li>
<li><strong>More fine-grained:</strong> CSI does not use synthetic values ​​(such as
RSSI) to measure the channel, but decomposes the entire channel measurement
into sub-carriers, and estimates the frequency response of each
sub-carrier, so as to determine the channel in the frequency domain. Make a
more fine-grained description.</li>
</ol>

<h3>1.4 Espressif CSI Advantage</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>All ESP32 series support CSI:</strong> ESP32 / ESP32-S2 / ESP32-C3 / ESP32-S3
/ ESP32-C6.</li>
<li><strong>Powerful ecology:</strong> Espressif is a global leader in the field of Wi-Fi
MCUs, combining CSI with existing IOT equipment.</li>
<li><strong>More information:</strong> Such as RSSI, RF noise floor, reception time and
antenna <code>rx_ctrl</code> field.</li>
<li><strong>Bluetooth Assist:</strong> ESP32 also supports BLE, for example, it can scan
surrounding devices to assist detection.</li>
<li><strong>Powerful processing capability:</strong> ESP32 CPU handles dual-core, 240MHz,
AI instructions. Can run machine learning and neural networks.</li>
</ol>

<h2>2 CSI Application</h2>

<h3>2.1 Intruder detection</h3>

<p>Select high-sensitivity sub-carrier combinations and signals from
non-line-of-sight path directions in different multipath propagation
environments, thereby enhancing the sensitivity of passive person detection
and expanding the detection range. This method can form "no blind spot"
intruder detection in security applications. The multipath propagation
characteristics of wireless signals indoors make wireless perception have
natural advantages in sensing range and directionality.</p>

<h3>2.2 Positioning and ranging</h3>

<p>You can learn from the RSSI method and use CSI as a more informative
fingerprint (including information on signal amplitude and phase on
multiple subcarriers), or rely on a frequency selective attenuation model
for more accurate ranging.</p>

<h3>2.3 Human activity detection and recognition</h3>

<p>Use CSI's high sensitivity to environmental changes to recognize human
movements, gestures, breathing and other small movements and daily
activities.</p>

<h2>3 Getting Started</h2>

<p>The Getting Started project can be found in the
<a href="./examples/console_test">examples/console_test</a> directory. It will help
you build a human activity detection application. See:
<a href="./examples/console_test/README.md">README</a>.</p>

<h2>4 How to get CSI</h2>

<h3>4.1 Get router CSI</h3>

<p><img src="docs/_static/get_router_csi.png" width="550"></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>How ​​to implement:</strong> ESP32 sends a Ping packet to the router, and
receives the CSI information carried in the Ping Replay returned by the
router.</li>
<li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Only one ESP32 plus router can be completed.</li>
<li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Depends on the router, such as the location of the
router, the supported Wi-Fi protocol, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Applicable scenario:</strong> There is only one ESP32 in the environment, and
there is a router in the detection environment.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4.2 Get CSI between devices</h3>

<p><img src="docs/_static/get_device_csi.png" width="550"></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>How ​​to implement:</strong> ESP32 A and B both send Ping packets to the
router, and ESP32 A receives the CSI information carried in the Ping Replay
returned by ESP32 B, which is a supplement to the first detection scenario.</li>
<li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Does not depend on the location of the router, and is not
affected by other devices connected under the router.</li>
<li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Depends on the Wi-Fi protocol supported by the router,
environment.</li>
<li><strong>Applicable scenario:</strong> There must be more than two ESP32s in the
environment.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4.3 Get CSI specific devices</h3>

<p><img src="docs/_static/get_broadcast_csi.png" width="550"></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>How ​​to implement:</strong> The packet sending device continuously switches
channels to send out packets. ESP32 A, B, and C all obtain the CSI
information carried in the broadcast packet of the packet sending device.
This method has the highest detection accuracy and reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Advantages:</strong> The completion is not affected by the router, and the
detection accuracy is high. When there are multiple devices in the
environment, only one packet sending device will cause little interference
to the network environment.</li>
<li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> In addition to the ordinary ESP32, it is also
necessary to add a special package issuing equipment, the cost is the same
and higher.</li>
<li><strong>Applicable scenarios:</strong> Suitable for scenarios that require high
accuracy and multi-device cluster positioning.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5 Note</h2>

<ol>
<li>The effect of external IPEX antenna is better than PCB antenna, PCB

<li>Test in an unmanned environment. Avoid the influence of other people's
activities on test results.</li>
